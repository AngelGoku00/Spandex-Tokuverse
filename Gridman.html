            After Khan Digifer's demise 22 years ago, Takeshi Todo, an adult, walks into a trash area that is stocked with computer monitors. When he comes across a computer display that looks a lot like Naoto's Junk, he experiences a sequence of flashbacks that take place during the battle in Computer World between Gridman and the monsters he created with Khan's assistance, which ended with a duel between Gridman and Khan Digifer. The city is terrorized as he watches the flashbacks and sees ghosts of his former monsters. After the flashbacks conclude, he is suddenly surrounded by several computer display lights, which bestows upon him an Accepter. When Takeshi turns into Gridman Sigma, the short film comes to a close.
